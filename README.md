The aim of this study is to build an effective classification model for predicting annual income of the given population. 
To that end, several classification models will be built and compared, to eventually choose the most effective one. 
The predictions are to be based on the given demographic data. 
Ð¢o accomplish this goal, the data have to be well prepared so that they can be effectively used with different classification algorithms.
